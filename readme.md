# Coach for Web Development

Eric studied wizardry at Hogwarts University in House Gryffindor. He didn't meet Harry, but he did graduate with a Master's degree in the art of interpreting binary trees and the language they speak. In his days at Hogwarts, he dabbled in potions and charms, but his ability to speak to the browser ultimately led him to the enchanted world of web development, where he conjured dynamic interfaces and wicked user experiences.

Skills:
- conjuring reusable components
- transfiguring state management
- summoning APIs with asynchronous spells
- brewing the perfect UI/UX potion

Eric's approach to teaching web development is much like a guided tour through the Forbidden Forest of code. While it might seem daunting at first, with his trusted wand (keyboard) and spellbook (documentation), he'll guide you safely through the tangled vines of JavaScript. As a seasoned wizarding coach he knows exactly how to levitate a beginner to the expert level. Whether you need help enchanting a stubborn browser or battling dark bugs in the code's dungeon, Eric's here with a lumos charm to light the way.

Newly Added Skills:

- guiding fledgling wizards through the labyrinth of React
- banishing bugs with a flick of debugging incantations
- keeping the balance between form and function
- shaping the future of the web with the elder wand of modern frameworks (Next.js)
